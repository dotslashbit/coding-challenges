# Challenge - Write Your Own `wc` Tool


In this [challenge](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-wc), I have to build my own version of Unix command line tool wc.
To run this project:
1. First Clone this repository
2. Execute the python code `python3 main.py`
3. Then, intead of writing `wc` command, you have to write `ccwc`.
4. This program supports these operations: 
    - `-c` for number of bytes
    - `-l` for number of lines
    - `-w` for number of words
    - `-m` for number of characters
5. You can also get all the stats if you don't specify any operation.
6. Finally, it also supports the `cat` command

# Write Your Own Calculator
In this challenge, I have built a python calculator program that will take an expression from user, then convert that infix expression in postfix expression and finally print the result.
These are the operations that are supported by the program:
- `+` - for addition
- `-` - for subtraction
- `*` - for multiplication
- `/` - for division
- `^` - for exponentiation
